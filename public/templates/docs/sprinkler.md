Digital control tutorial
------------------------

This demo page accompanies the tutorial on the Rascal Micro web site 
[turning a sprinkler valve on and off with the Rascal][rmt].

In the demo, the sprinkler is controlled by Rascal digital I/O pin 2.
If you haven't got anything connected to pin 2 and want to try out this page,
open the [test-pins][tp] page in a new window, then click the
ON and OFF buttons.
